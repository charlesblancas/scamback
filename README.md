# Scamback
ScamBack starts by contacting known scam phone numbers from a public database. Once connected, the app impersonates one of the scam victims the scammers typically prey on. Through AI-generated dialogue and realistic voice synthesis, it keeps the scammer engaged in conversation, wasting their time and preventing them from targeting real victims. The app continuously adapts to the scammer's responses, creating a dynamic and unpredictable experience that makes it harder for scammers to detect it's not a real person.
